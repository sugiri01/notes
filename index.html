                    <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for being here today. I'm honored to present my thesis defense on PREDICT-HOME, which stands for "An Explainable Hybrid Deep Learning System for Adaptive Domestic Energy Forecasting."</p>
                    
                    <p>This research sits at the intersection of machine learning, energy management, and human-computer interaction. The core challenge I've addressed is how to create energy forecasting systems that are not only accurate but also transparent and adaptable to changing household behaviors.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge my supervisors [mention names] for their guidance throughout this research journey, and [mention any funding bodies or collaborators] for their support.</p>

                    <p>First, I'll introduce the topic by explaining the societal context that makes this research necessary. I'll discuss the global energy challenges we face and the specific engineering problems that need solving in household energy forecasting.</p>
                    
                    <p>Second, I'll evaluate the existing literature in this field. We'll look at current approaches to energy forecastingâ€”from statistical methods to advanced deep learningâ€”and analyze their limitations, which my research aims to address.</p>

                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>Let's start by understanding why domestic energy forecasting matters in the broader context of global energy challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>Residential energy consumption represents <span class="emphasis">27%</span> of global energy usageâ€”that's more than a quarter of all energy consumed worldwide. This makes it a critical sector for optimization and efficiency improvements.</p>
                    
                    <p>The widespread deployment of smart meters in homes across developed countries has created an unprecedented opportunity. These devices generate detailed energy consumption data every 30 minutes or even more frequently, creating rich datasets that were simply not available to researchers a decade ago.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the same time, we're experiencing significant energy price volatility, which has increased by <span class="emphasis">45%</span> since 2018. This volatility affects both consumers who face unpredictable bills and utilities that must manage fluctuating demand.</p>
                    
                    <p>These factors combine to create an urgent need for better demand forecasting and management systems. If we can accurately predict when and how much energy households will use, we can optimize everything from individual consumption patterns to grid-level resource allocation.</p>
                    
                    <div class="tip-box">

                        <p>Emphasize the "27%" and "45%" statistics with vocal inflection. Pause after mentioning the smart meter opportunity to let the significance sink in.</p>

                    <div class="slide-title">Need for Intelligent Energy Forecast</div>
                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>The need for intelligent energy forecasting can be understood through three key impact areas:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
                    <p>From an economic perspective, the average UK household spends Â£1,138 annually on electricity. Our research indicates that through optimized consumption based on accurate forecasting, households could save between 12-18% on these costs. That's about Â£136-Â£205 per year per householdâ€”a significant saving, especially for lower-income families.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                    <p>The environmental impact is equally compelling. Enhanced demand-side flexibilityâ€”the ability to shift energy usage to optimal timesâ€”could reduce carbon emissions by 25 million tonnes annually by 2035. This reduction comes from both more efficient energy use and better integration of renewable energy sources, which often have variable output dependent on weather conditions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Grid Resilience</h3>
                    <p>For grid resilience, improved demand forecasting could reduce the required operating reserveâ€”essentially backup power capacityâ€”by up to 30%. This means fewer power plants need to be kept on standby, reducing costs and emissions. It also enhances stability during peak demand periods, when the grid is most vulnerable to failures.</p>
                    
                    <p>These three areasâ€”economic benefits, environmental sustainability, and grid resilienceâ€”together demonstrate the substantial value proposition of advanced energy forecasting. This isn't just an academic exercise; it has real-world implications for households, utilities, and our planet.</p>
                    
                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <div class="tip-title">Speaker Note</div>
                        <p>Use three-finger gesture when mentioning the three key impact areas. Take a moment to connect the economic, environmental, and resilience benefits as a cohesive value proposition.</p>

            <div class="slide-section">

                    <div class="slide-number">5-6</div>
                    <div class="slide-title">Engineering Challenges in Energy Forecasting</div>
                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>Developing effective energy forecasting systems faces three significant engineering challenges:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. The Black Box Problem</h3>
                    <p>The first challenge is what I call "The Black Box Problem." Deep learning models can provide impressive accuracy in predictions, but they typically operate as black boxes, offering little insight into how they arrive at their conclusions. This lack of transparency is problematic because our research shows that <span class="emphasis">67%</span> of consumers are hesitant to use AI systems they don't understand. For adoption in real households, people need to trust and comprehend the system's recommendations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Adaptation to Changing Behaviors</h3>
                    <p>The second challenge concerns adaptation to changing behaviors. Household consumption patterns aren't staticâ€”they can change dramatically by up to <span class="emphasis">30%</span> following major life events like having a child, changing jobs, or purchasing new appliances. Traditional static models require frequent complete retraining to capture these changes, which is computationally expensive and often impractical in real-world applications.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Generalization Across Households</h3>
                    <p>The third challenge involves generalization across households. Models trained on specific households typically perform poorly when applied to others with different characteristics. Each home has unique appliances, occupancy patterns, and user behaviors. This means we need sophisticated transfer learning approaches that can adapt knowledge from one context to another while preserving accuracy.</p>
                    
                    <p>These three challengesâ€”lack of transparency, limited adaptability, and poor generalizationâ€”form the core technical problems my research addresses. By solving these issues, PREDICT-HOME aims to create energy forecasting systems that are not only accurate but also practical for real-world deployment in diverse households.</p>

                        <div class="tip-title">Speaker Note</div>
                        <p>When explaining each challenge, use specific examples that non-technical audience members can relate to. For the black box problem, you might mimic looking into an opaque container. For adaptation, consider a gesture showing transformation.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>To understand where my research fits in the broader landscape, let's examine the evolution of energy forecasting methods and their relative strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Statistical Methods</h3>
                    <p>Traditional statistical methods like ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and Exponential Smoothing achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3-6%. These methods offer high interpretabilityâ€”you can easily follow the mathematical logicâ€”but they have low adaptability to changing patterns and can miss complex, non-linear relationships in the data.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Machine Learning Approaches</h3>
                    <p>Machine learning approaches like Random Forests and Support Vector Regression (SVR) show a 15-20% improvement over statistical methods. They offer medium interpretabilityâ€”we can understand feature importance but not the full decision processâ€”and medium adaptability to changing conditions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Deep Learning Methods</h3>
                    <p>Deep learning methods, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer up to 30% improvement in accuracy over statistical methods. However, they typically have low interpretabilityâ€”functioning as black boxesâ€”while providing high adaptability to changing consumption patterns.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hybrid Models</h3>
                    <p>Hybrid models, which combine different approaches, generally show the best performance in terms of accuracy. However, like pure deep learning models, they still struggle with interpretability.</p>
                    
                    <p>The key observation here is that most approaches sacrifice either accuracy or interpretability. This trade-off represents a significant gap in the field that my research directly addresses. PREDICT-HOME aims to maintain the high accuracy of deep learning while significantly improving interpretability.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>Diving deeper into the explainability aspect, let's examine the current approaches and their limitations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Feature Importance Methods</h3>
                    <p>Feature importance methods like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) provide post-hoc explanations of model predictions. While useful, these explanations come after the prediction is made, not during the model's decision process. This limits their actionabilityâ€”the ability for users to act on the explanations to modify their behavior.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Attention Mechanisms</h3>
                    <p>Attention mechanisms in neural networks have shown improved results, with up to <span class="emphasis">17%</span> better performance by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input data. However, these visualizations remain difficult for non-experts to interpret. A heat map showing attention weights might be clear to a data scientist but confusing to an average homeowner.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hybrid Architectures</h3>
                    <p>Hybrid architectures that combine interpretable components with high-accuracy deep learning show promising direction but remain underdeveloped specifically in the energy domain. Most research in explainable AI has focused on computer vision or natural language processing, with less attention to time-series forecasting for energy.</p>
                    
                    <p>My research addresses this gap by developing explainability methods specifically designed for energy forecasting, integrating them directly into the model architecture rather than applying them as an afterthought. This approach ensures that explanations are both accurate and accessible to non-expert users.</p>

                    <div class="slide-title">Key Limitations in Current Research</div>
                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>To summarize the key limitations in current research:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-off</h3>
                    <p>Most approaches sacrifice one for the other. Highly accurate models like deep neural networks are typically black boxes, while more interpretable models like decision trees often can't capture the complex patterns in energy consumption data.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Limited Adaptability</h3>
                    <p>Most models require extensive retraining to adjust to changing consumption patterns. This is impractical for real-world applications where household behaviors evolve continuously.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Poor Generalization</h3>
                    <p>Models don't transfer well between different households. A system trained on one family's data often performs poorly when applied to another household with different appliances and behaviors.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Computational Complexity</h3>
                    <p>Many advanced models are too resource-intensive for practical use in home energy management systems, which typically have limited computational resources.</p>
                    
                    <p>PREDICT-HOME addresses these limitations directly through its novel architecture and approach. By integrating explainability from the ground up, implementing online learning for adaptation, and designing for cross-household transfer learning, my system aims to overcome these critical barriers to practical energy forecasting.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>The vision for PREDICT-HOME goes beyond just creating another forecasting algorithm. It envisions intelligent energy forecasting that empowers households to optimize consumption, reduce costs, and contribute to a more sustainable energy system.</p>
                    
                    <p>The key to this empowerment is providing not just predictions, but understanding. By delivering accurate predictions with clear explanations, the system enables users to comprehend:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emphasis">What</span> their future consumption will beâ€”giving them concrete numbers and time frames for expected energy usage.</li>
                        <li><span class="emphasis">Why</span> certain patterns emerge in their usageâ€”identifying factors like weather conditions, occupancy patterns, or specific appliance usage that drive consumption.</li>
                        <li><span class="emphasis">How</span> their consumption patterns can be modifiedâ€”offering actionable insights that enable users to make informed decisions about when and how they use energy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This approach transforms energy forecasting from a purely technical exercise into a tool for household empowerment. By understanding their energy usage patterns and the factors that influence them, users can take control of their consumption in ways that weren't previously possible.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>To realize this vision, I've defined five specific, measurable objectives:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Design a hybrid CNN-LSTM neural network with attention mechanisms</h3>
                    <p>The convolutional components will capture local patterns in energy usage, while the LSTM components will model long-term dependencies. Attention mechanisms will help the model focus on the most relevant time periods. This architecture aims to achieve a <span class="emphasis">15%</span> accuracy improvement over baseline models.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Develop an integrated explainability framework</h3>
                    <p>Using SHAP values to quantify the importance of different features and attention visualization to highlight which time periods most influenced the prediction. This isn't a post-hoc explanation but an integral part of the model's architecture.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Implement an online learning mechanism</h3>
                    <p>That allows the model to adapt to changing consumption patterns without complete retraining. This is crucial for real-world applications where household behaviors evolve continuously.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Create a specialized peak demand prediction component</h3>
                    <p>With at least <span class="emphasis">85%</span> precision and recall for high-consumption periods. This is particularly important for grid management and for households on time-of-use tariffs where energy costs more during peak times.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Develop an interactive visualization dashboard</h3>
                    <p>That presents forecasts, explanations, and uncertainty estimates in an intuitive way. This ensures that the technical sophistication of the model translates into practical value for users.</p>
                    
                    <p>These objectives collectively address the limitations identified in current research while aligning with the overall vision of empowering households through energy understanding.</p>

                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>PREDICT-HOME's architecture consists of four integrated layers, each serving a distinct purpose:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Data Processing Layer</h3>
                    <p>Handles smart meter data preprocessing and feature engineering. This includes cleaning raw data, handling missing values, normalizing inputs, and creating derived features that capture temporal patterns like day of week, season, and holidays. This layer ensures that the data fed into the model is high-quality and information-rich.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Modeling Layer</h3>
                    <p>Contains three key components: the hybrid CNN-LSTM with attention mechanisms for accurate forecasting, the online learning component that allows the model to adapt to changing patterns, and the peak demand prediction module that specializes in identifying high-consumption periods.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Explainability Layer</h3>
                    <p>Includes SHAP implementation for feature importance, attention visualization that shows which time periods most influenced the prediction, and a natural language explanation generator that translates technical insights into user-friendly text. This layer ensures that users can understand and trust the system's predictions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. User Interface Layer</h3>
                    <p>Provides an interactive dashboard for visualizations and insights, shows forecasts with prediction intervals to communicate uncertainty, and visualizes performance metrics so users can assess the system's reliability.</p>
                    
                    <p>This layered architecture ensures modularity and maintainability, allowing each component to be developed, tested, and refined independently while working together as an integrated system.</p>

                    <div class="slide-title">Key Components</div>
                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>Let me elaborate on the three key components that form the technical core of PREDICT-HOME:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Hybrid CNN-LSTM Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Leverages the strengths of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks. CNNs excel at capturing local patterns in consumption data, identifying usage signatures of specific appliances or activities. LSTMs excel at modeling long-term temporal dependencies, tracking patterns that span hours, days, or weeks. Attention mechanisms enhance both by focusing on the most relevant time steps for prediction. Together, these elements aim for a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of <span class="emphasis">10% or less</span> for 24-hour forecastsâ€”a substantial improvement over current approaches.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Explainability Framework</h3>
                    <p>Works on multiple levels: feature importance quantification using SHAP values helps users understand which factors (weather, time of day, previous usage) most influenced the prediction; temporal importance via attention visualization highlights which specific time periods had the greatest impact; and comprehensive user testing ensures that these explanations are actually meaningful to non-expert users.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Online Learning & Adaptability</h3>
                    <p>Provides incremental model updates with new data, allowing the system to continuously learn without full retraining. It includes concept drift detection mechanisms that can identify when consumption patterns have significantly changed, triggering more substantial model updates. The goal is to recover accuracy within <span class="emphasis">48 hours</span> after pattern changesâ€”much faster than traditional approaches that might require weeks of new data.</p>
                    
                    <p>These components work together to create a system that is not only accurate but also explainable and adaptableâ€”addressing the key limitations of current energy forecasting approaches.</p>

                    <h3>Weeks 1-2: Foundation</h3>
                    <p>Focus on foundational work: conducting a thorough literature review to ensure my approach builds on and extends current knowledge; collecting and processing data from smart meter datasets; and performing feature engineering to create meaningful inputs for the model.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Weeks 3-5: Core Modeling</h3>

                    <div class="slide-title">Risk Assessment and Mitigation</div>
                </div>
                <div class="slide-content">
                    <p>I've identified five key risks that could impact the project's success and developed mitigation strategies for each:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Data Quality Issues (High Impact, Medium Likelihood)</h3>
                    <p>Smart meter data often contains gaps, errors, or inconsistencies. I'll mitigate this by focusing on the UK-DALE dataset, which is well-documented and validated. I'll also implement a robust preprocessing pipeline with outlier detection to identify and handle problematic data points before they affect model training.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Computational Complexity (High Impact, Medium Likelihood)</h3>
                    <p>Deep learning models, especially hybrids, can be computationally intensive. I'll address this through model pruning and optimization techniques, establishing clear performance budgets for training and inference times, and using progressive refinement approaches that start with simpler models and add complexity incrementally.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Explainability-Accuracy Trade-off (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)</h3>
                    <p>Enhancing explainability might compromise predictive performance. I'll manage this through multi-objective optimization that explicitly balances these competing goals and ensemble approaches that combine highly accurate components with more interpretable ones.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Concept Drift Detection Reliability (Medium Impact, High Likelihood)</h3>
                    <p>Detecting when consumption patterns have changed is challenging but essential for adaptation. I'll implement multiple complementary drift detection mechanisms and validate them on synthetic data with controlled pattern changes to ensure reliability.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Limited Generalization (High Impact, Medium Likelihood)</h3>
                    <p>I'll address this by using diverse training datasets representing different household types, implementing household clustering to group similar homes, and developing transfer learning techniques that adapt pre-trained models to new households with minimal additional data.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each risk will be continuously monitored throughout the project lifecycle, with mitigation strategies adjusted based on actual progress and challenges encountered. This proactive approach to risk management increases the likelihood of project success despite the technical challenges involved.</p>

                        <div class="tip-title">Speaker Note</div>
                        <p>The risk assessment demonstrates your thorough planning and foresight. Emphasize that identifying risks early allows for proactive rather than reactive management. Consider using a brief example of how one risk was identified through preliminary research.</p>
